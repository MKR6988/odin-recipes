        <li>Add the rice and water and bring to a boil. Season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer to a serving platter. Top with fried onions, chopped cilantro, and sliced green chilies. Serve hot.</li>
