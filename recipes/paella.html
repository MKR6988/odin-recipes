      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large paella pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and add them to the pan, skin-side down. Cook until the skin is browned and crispy, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic, and bell peppers to the pan and saut√© for 3-4 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, smoked paprika, and saffron to the pan and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pan and stir to coat it in the tomato mixture. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth to the pan and bring to a simmer. Return the chicken thighs to the pan, along with any accumulated juices. Cover the pan and simmer for 20-25 minutes, until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, steam the mussels and clams in a separate pot until they open. Discard any that do not open.</li>
        <li>Add the shrimp, mussels, and clams to the paella pan and cook for another 5-10 minutes, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
