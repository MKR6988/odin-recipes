      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, stirring occasionally, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic to the skillet and cook for an additional minute, or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>When the spaghetti is cooked, reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Immediately add the spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta or bacon and garlic. Toss to combine and coat the spaghetti with the rendered fat.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat, then quickly stir in the egg yolk mixture until it coats the spaghetti evenly. Add pasta water a tablespoon at a time, as needed, to create a creamy sauce.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste and serve immediately.</li>
