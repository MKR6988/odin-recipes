      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Clean the duck inside and out, removing any excess fat and pinfeathers. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the honey, rice vinegar, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, hoisin sauce, five-spice powder, garlic, scallions, and ginger. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Hold the duck by its neck and ladle the hot liquid all over the bird, making sure to coat it thoroughly. Hang the duck up by its neck and let it dry for 24 hours in a cool, dry place.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the duck on a rack in a roasting pan and roast for 1 hour, until the skin is golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>While the duck is roasting, make the sauce. Combine the liquid from the roasting pan with the cornstarch mixture in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Remove the duck from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. Serve with pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and the sauce.</li>
      </ol>
